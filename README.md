# Taskukirja API Reverse-Engineered
Reverse-Engineered Taskukirja API Documentation

In this repository, I will make an documentation how to use Taskukirja API in your projects.

There are several "Clone apps" of Taskukirja app. They have different API Server.

Taskukirja: https://taskukirja.enisoft.fi/prd
KirjastoON: https://aurora-kerava.enisoft.fi/prd


## How to continue digging the app?

Simple, the app is written in Xamarin, and you can extract DLLs from APK and read the whole source code.

You can use tools such as ILSpy or dotPeek to read the source code.
Extract the APK using some unzip program. DLLs are in folder "assemblies"


I don't hold any responsibility on what are you doing with this discovery.
And I don't guarantee 100% correctness on the documentation, as it can change without anyone noticing it.
